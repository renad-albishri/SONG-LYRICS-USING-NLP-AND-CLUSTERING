# Song Lyrics Using NLP and Clustering
## Introduction
The main focus of this project is break down and analyze the under meaning of song lyrics using Natrual Langauge Processing and Clustering as part of machine
learning algorithms and to devide them into topics for further investigation.

## Data Description
The chosen dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neisse/scrapped-lyrics-from-6-genres?select=lyrics-data.csv) which contains two seperate dataset
one is meant for the artists and the other one is for the song lyrics which is the main point of this project's intrest.<br>
The data includes songs from 6 different genres of all time:
- Rock
- Hip Hop
- Pop music
- Sertanejo (Basically the Brazilian version of Country Music)
- Funk Carioca (Originated 60s US Funk, a completely different genre in Brazil nowadays)
- Samba (Typical Brazilian music)

The whole data contains up to **209,523** rows and **5** columns. But all non-english songs will be excluded which leaves the new dataset with
**114,723** rows and **5** columns.

## Tools
Here the basic tools that will be used: <br/>
Technologies: python, and Jupyter Notebook with python libraries:
- For Exploratory Data Analysis:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - seaborn
- For Natrual Language Processing:
  - scikit-learn
  - Topic Modeling
  - NLTK
  - NMF
  - LDA
  - LSA
- For Clustering:
  - K-means
- Website:
  - Streamlit Tool
  
## Conclusion
This project aims to digest all known songs from different genres to break it down into pieces with the help of Natrual Language Processing and Clustering
algorithms to get useful insights.
